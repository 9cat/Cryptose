Cryptose
========

Cryptose is an addictive cryptogram game with three gritty occupations to choose from: Hacker, Detective, or Spy. It's available in the iOS App Store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cryptose/id368874791?mt=8 and the Android Market: market://details?id=com.insurgentgames.cryptose

Cryptose was programmed in C++ using the Airplay SDK, which has since been renamed to the Marmalade SDK: http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/

It was made using Airplay SDK 4.2, and it probably won't compile out-of-the box in the latest version of Marmalade. If anyone wants to get it to run using the newest Marmalade, patches are welcome.

Game Description
----------------

Cryptose is an addictive cryptogram puzzle game where you use logic and reasoning to decode secret messages. Choose between three occupations to play as a hacker, a detective, or a spy.

Each game you get a random short encrypted phrase and it's your job to decrypt it. The phrase is encrypted with a simple substitution cipher, meaning that each letter in the alphabet is replaced with another letter (for example, all A's might be replaced with Q's). You start out with the ciphertext, and you decode it letter-by-letter until you reveal the plaintext message.

Features:

* Thousands of phrases to decrypt
* Three gritty graphical themes to choose from
* Unlimited hints to curb frustration
* Learn interesting facts and quotes about encryption, cypherpunks, and code-breaking

Insurgent Games
---------------

Insurgent Games was founded in 2009 by Micah Lee and Crystal Mayer out of their San Francisco studio apartment. For a couple of years they made iPhone and Android games while doing other work on the side. They quickly realized that unless you're incredibly lucky, it's hard to make enough money doing indie mobile game development to pay San Francisco rent, and so Micah got a full time job and Crystal moved on to other things.

Now, several years later, Micah works for the Electronic Frontier Foundation defending internet users from evil (https://www.eff.org/files/xkcd_comic.png), and Crystal is a freelance web designer (http://moonsprocket.com/). But Insurgent Games is dormant.

Since we're not working on the games anymore, we decided to release them to the community where maybe they can thrive and be reborn as bigger and better things. All of our games are licensed under the GNU General Public License.
